What is Ghosts?
----------------

Ghosts is a Bukkit plugin that changes the way players die. When a player dies he will create
a tombstone at the death location (a chest with his stuff stored in it). 
The player will respawn at a random location near his death point and must find his tombstone
in order to retrieve his stuff. If he does not succeed to find his tombstone in time it will get destroyed.

### Dev builds
The latest development builds are available [here](http://ci.md-5.net/job/Ghosts/).
